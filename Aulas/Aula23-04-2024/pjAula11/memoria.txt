Glowing windows in the buildings from the elevated train
I see a thousand different stories pass
Faces without names
Forget why I came here, and I forget why I stay
And I wonder if they noticed,
If I slipped away

What if I kept going?
What if I don't get off tonight?
What if I ride this to the edges?
Through the darkness, to the light
Could I find you? There?
Could I find you? There?
If I slipped away?

What if there's no answers we're all just hearts that have to fight
Through the dangers of the rapids
Through the darkness, to the light
Could I find you? There?
Could I find you? There?
If I slipped away?
